# Holiday-Manager
Holiday Manager for M07 Assessment

This program creates a list of holiday names and dates from 2020-2024. Initial information is pulled from https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ and the holidays.json file. The user can add custom holidays, delete holidays from the list, and view the the list for a selected time period. If viewing the current week, weather descriptions from https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/ are available. The final list can then be saved.

The main file, holiday_startercode.py, must be run in the same directory as holidays.json to function.

Any changes that are saved are written to holidaysoutput.json in the same directory as the main program.
